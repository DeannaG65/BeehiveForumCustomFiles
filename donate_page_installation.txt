The donate page allows you to collect donations to help pay the operating expenses of your site.
 It also has a scrollable div for you to display other things if you want, like advertisers who will give you monies for sales.

First you need to download a copy of donate.php and edit it to suit your needs. Instructions are included within the file.
After editing, save it and upload it to your Beehive root directory.
Examples:  home/user/public_html/Beehive or home/user/public_html/forum

Next choose which nav.php file you want to use for your site.
nav_donate.php limits gues access. Guests see Start, Message, Login, Register, and Donate.
nav_donate2.php does not limit guest access to the navtabs.
Once you've chosen which of these files you want to use, download and rename it to nav.php.
Either rename the default nav.php you have on your site or delete it.
My suggestion would be to keep a copy of it somewhere safe in the event you encounter unforeseen problems.
Once you've cleared the way, upload your new nav.php file to your Beehive directory.

Now all that is left is for you to  do a little CSS editing.
Go your styles folder, then go into each style folder there and edit style.css.
You need to add .nav_donate to it.
You'll most likely want to style it the same as your other navtabs. so it's a good idea to put it in that section.
It makes it easier if you need to find it.
